WakingWind
==========

>“Waking Wind” is a webservice with realtime weatherdata for windsportmen. The slogan “real-time wind data from anywhere to everywhere” describes the focus of easy data retrieval even from the most abandoned places as well as the easy access to the data on-the-go.

This project was created during the summer semester 2013 at the Hochschule der Medien in Stuttgart. I created this project together with my fellow student Thorsten Schaeff.

Our goal was it to create a realtime weather service for wind sportsmen in egypt. Often, these people live far away from the surf spot without access to accurate wind speed data.

The final product features the outside station of a cheap weather station, the custom receiver, a RaspberryPi to collect the data and send it to the Webserver, a Website and a Mobile App for Android that let you set an Alarm and notifies you as soon as the windspeed exceeds a set threshold.
